  The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development framework to create scalable and extensible projects.
  
  Model–view–controller is an architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to user and accepted from the user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development.
  
  MVC是一个一种软件设计典范，用一种（业务逻辑、数据、界面显示）分离的方法组织代码，将业务逻辑聚集到一个部件里面，在改进和个性化定制（界面及用户交互）的同时，不需要重新编写业务逻辑。MVC被独特的发展起来用于映射传统的（输入、处理和输出功能）在一个逻辑的图形化用户界面的结构中。

##Spring - MVC Framework

   The Spring Web MVC framework provides Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and ready components that can be used to develop flexible and loosely coupled web applications. The MVC pattern results in separating the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.
